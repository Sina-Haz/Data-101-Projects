Here I use a lot of data cleaning and optimization in order to create an accurate regression model that takes in data about a city bike ride, and
predicts trip duration. This data is trained with one dataset and tested against many others and finally submitted to kaggle. This submission earned me 5th
place in terms of accurately predicting the trip duration on kaggle.
